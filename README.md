# NUB's QoL Mods

Welcome to my small quality of life mod for minecraft

## Features

### Hit mobs through non-solid blocks

When attacking at a mob behind/inside non-solid block such as grass/tall grass, sugarcane, flowers etc. the attack will be redirected to the mob instead of the block.

Quite useful in when in biomes with lots of grass and flowers or while building sugarcane farms

### Easy elytra takeoff

Tired of having to press the space bar twice when you want to take off with an elytra?
Well how about zero! With easy elytra takeoff, just right click with a firework rocket and take off from anywhere!

Note: You have to be looking at a non-solid block or in the air for it to work. The rockets will behave normally when looking at a solid block.

Another note: You have to be mid-air to initiate easy elytra launch when the mod is installed client-side only (does not affect single player)

### WIP: Inventory/container sorting

Use a hotkey when hovering over a container to instantly sort them. The default hotkey is middle mouse button, this can
be changed however

### WIP: Hold and drag item transfer

When having an open container, hold the left mouse button and drag to instantly transfer items to or from the container
