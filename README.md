Welcome to my small quality of life mod for minecraft

</div>

## Features

### Easy elytra takeoff

Tired of having to press the space bar twice when you want to take off with an elytra?
Well how about zero! With easy elytra takeoff, just right click with a firework rocket and take off from anywhere!

Note: You cannot be looking at a block when taking off. This mod does not override the default implementation when
right-clicking a block

Another note: This function requires the mod installed both on the client and the server (Does not affect single-player)

### Inventory/container sorting

Use a hotkey when hovering over a container to instantly sort them. The default hotkey is middle mouse button, this can
be changed however

### Hold and drag item transfer

When having an open container, hold the left mouse button and drag to instantly transfer items to or from the container
